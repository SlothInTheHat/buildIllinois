[11:18:06 PM] so you can actually like live transcribe what you're saying and so it's like it's like an interview right so like if you were reading the question you'd be like okay so just to be clear like whether the constraints okay so I need like N squared time and what will not
[11:18:08 PM]  and then
[11:18:13 PM]  and then like what happened
[11:18:18 PM]  and it'll be able to like respond hopefully and also like text to speech
[11:18:26 PM]  and I guess we'll like add text to it too it's really annoying how this doesn't scroll down by itself
[11:18:34 PM]  hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello new line new line
[11:18:49 PM]  I want to see if it actually goes no it doesn't oh doesn't like scrolls??
